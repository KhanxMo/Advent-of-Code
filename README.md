# üéÑ Advent of Code

A repo to hold my (usually shit) solutions to some AoC problems!


## What is Advent of Code? ü§î
Advent of Code is an annual event that happens each December. It's a series of fun, holiday-themed programming puzzles that cover a wide range of challenges. People from all around the world participate, using any programming language they prefer, to solve one puzzle a day up until Christmas. It's a great way to improve coding skills, learn new concepts, and join a vibrant community of coding enthusiasts.

**Code Quality** -  Think of this repository as a buffet - you'll find some gourmet dishes and some... let's say, experimental recipes. In other words, while I strive for brilliance, sometimes I happily settle for "it works!".
